### EXPLANATION ###

# 1. Here in Frontend we con't run application directly using node distroless image, { to Reduce image size } so we can put a build in node image and  
#     Copy the Dist file then using the Nginx image {Minimal image} to Deploy. need to create "nginx.conf"



# 1. Here we run an application using  npm directly for a development environment, npm will hit the pacakage.json file first then search and
#     run the mentioned dev command. " CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"] "

#------------ Without Distroless Image -------------
